I'm here because I'm interested in cooperation, in an anti-multinational environment, in something I don't know yet but feel attracted to know more, because I feel you're going against the flow, because maybe I can contribute. Had my fair share of multinationals, made a mistake by not being me. So putting myself on track, consuming music, making tours in the wild with my mountainbike, wanting to learn freestyle swim (failing for now, got the gear though), wanting to be in an environment which feels similar. Not home or an exact copy.
